# Goose Purgatory

GOOSE_PURGATORY is an endless high-score based survival platformer. 

Collect the BREAD on each floor.

Between floors, either ESCAPE your purgatory or CONTINUE.

CONTINUING will require you to make a SACRIFICE, either weakening yourself or adding/strengthening different CREATURES.

Made for the Hack Club Daydream game jam - "Sacrifices must be made"
